## About me:
I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Nanoelectronics, but over time I realized that I was more attracted to other areas, such as development. In addition, I have always liked visual creativity (in particular, I was engaged in digital drawing and 3D modeling), which additionally influenced the desire to engage in front-end development - and here I am.
My strengths include quick learning, reliability, responsibility, as well as the skill of working in a team.

## Skills:

* Python (*basic*)
* C++ (*basic*)

## Sample code:

return (a * b);
}
let product = multiply (2, 2);
```
