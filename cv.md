## About me:
I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Nanoelectronics, but over time I realized that I was more attracted to other areas, such as development. In addition, I have always liked visual creativity (in particular, I was engaged in digital drawing and 3D modeling), which additionally influenced the desire to engage in front-end development.
My strengths include quick learning, reliability, responsibility, as well as the skill of working in a team.

## Skills:

* Python (*basic*)
* C++ (*basic*)
* HTML (*basic*)
* CSS (*basic*)
* JavaScript (*basic*)
* Git
* VS Code
* Photoshop, ZBrush

## Sample code:

```
let validWord = function(dictionary, word) {
  let re = new RegExp(`^(${dictionary.join('|')})*$`, "g");
  return re.test(`${word}`)
};
```
